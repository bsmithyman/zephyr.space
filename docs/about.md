# About

Zephyr is the product of research at the [University of Western Ontario][UWO], with funding through a NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship to Brendan Smithyman and an NSERC Discovery Grant to R. Gerhard Pratt. The implementation of anisotropic acoustic wave equation (`zephyr.backend.Eurus`) is the work of Shaun Hadden, an MSc candidate at [UWO][].

In addition, Zephyr interoperates tightly with [SimPEG][], a flexible tool for designing and executing geophysical inversion problems. In turn, both Zephyr and SimPEG are dependent on the [Python][] programming language, [NumPy][], [SciPy][] and [Jupyter][]/[IPython][]. Please check out and support these open-source projects.
