# Intro

Welcome to the documentation and development site for Zephyr: an open-source seismic full-waveform inversion toolkit. Zephyr is designed to offer a convenient, easy-to-use set of tools and components that enable seismic FWI. Most importantly, Zephyr is free and open-source, so you can use it for your own projects and/or contribute to its development. Zephyr continues to gain features and improve daily.
